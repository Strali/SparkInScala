# Spark In Scala - Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

This repo contains code for the last two assignment of the exellent Coursera course on Spark in Scala by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, taught by Dr. Heather Miller. The first assignment was unfortunately lost due to git shenanigans.

## Requirements
Some (may or may not be a complete list) requirements:
```
Scala 2.11.x
Spark 2.3
Download the correct .csv files from the course webpage
```
Spark installation and configuration is an episode in itself and is left as an exercise to the reader.
